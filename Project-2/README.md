## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index

This is the skeleton of the page, it contains all the markup that would be built upon by CSS and JavaScript. Note the values of `id`, `class` and `data` attributes of all the HTML elements.

## App

This is where all the functionality of the web page occurs. There are three main things that are achieved in this section: 

1. Building the navigation menu dynamically.
2. Making sure that the user is able to distinguish the section in view.
3. Making sure that the user can scroll to each section by clicking the section link on the navbar.
